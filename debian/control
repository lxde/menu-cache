Description: an implementation of the freedesktop menu specification for LXDE
 Libmenu-cache is a library creating and utilizing caches to speed up
 the manipulation for freedesktop.org defined application menus.
 It can be used as a replacement of libgnome-menu of gnome-menus.
 .
  * Shorten time for loading menu entries.
  * Ease of use. (API is very similar to that of libgnome-menu)
  * Lightweight runtime library. (Parsing of the menu definition files 
    are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really changed.)
  * Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
  * Heavily reduced disk I/O.
